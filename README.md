## About

This is a website for a small immigration firm based in Washington, DC. The site is designed to be accessible, responsive, and seamlessly available in both Spanish and English.

Site is currently only in the testing and development phase, but is built using Gatsby. Translation will be handled through i18n-next. Headless CMS is yet to be integrated, but will likely be Butter CMS or Netlify CMS.
